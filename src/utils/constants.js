export const launchHostDes = "Built a fully containerized cloud hosting platform using Docker and AWS ECS that enables automated, parallel code deployments directly from GitHub, supported by a reverse proxy system for dynamic hosting and output mapping. Integrated Kafka with ClickHouse for real-time log streaming and analytics, optimized asset delivery through AWS S3 and CDN, and improved overall system performance using Redis for fast caching."
export const tpsDes = "Developed an intelligent, LLM-powered chatbot system capable of handling real-time financial transactions, integrated with AWS DynamoDB for seamless data storage and updates. Implemented OCR models to extract and structure text from uploaded documents, enabling automated validation, issue resolution, and transaction confirmation through OpenAI APIs, resulting in a fully dynamic and interactive processing flow."

export const researchAssitant = "I optimized performance in high-performance virtual machine and compute environments. I improved task queue management by conducting root cause analysis and fine-tuning Spring and Java worker allocation algorithms. This work significantly reduced latency and boosted system efficiency. Additionally, I built an internal bot for real-time workflow monitoring and task status updates, facilitating better resource allocation and swift bottleneck resolution. I ensured development adhered to secure coding practices and thoroughly documented design specifications for future scalability."
export const sde = "I focused on data management and system architecture within an Agile development environment. I implemented a Python-driven data pipeline to manage updates for a GraphQL database (over 500,000 entries), which enhanced data integrity and reduced manual input errors by 60%. I also built a scalable microservice architecture using various AWS services (EC2, ECR, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB). By integrating distributed storage solutions, I significantly improved overall system performance, scalability, and reliability."
